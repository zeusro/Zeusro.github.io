A particle exists in a superposition of multiple states until it is observed and collapses.

## Life Analogy

When you go to buy coffee, before you decide, you are simultaneously in a superposition of "ordering Americano," "ordering Latte," and "ordering Cappuccino."
Only when it's your turn to order do you collapse into one of these choices.

## Multidimensional Universe Hypothesis

## Proof Process

In the [5-dimensional world](https://github.com/zeusro/math/blob/main/n/5.zh.md) I defined, consciousness is the most difficult level to understand.
Therefore, for N-dimensional line segments, I proposed [multiple interpretations](https://www.zeusro.com/2025/06/29/ab/).
The simplest example is the problem of encountering a road blocker on the way to school. You don't know when the blocker will finally leave, so you can only call 122 and ask them to help contact the car owner.
Or transform the problem into a "Waiting for Godot" dilemma—you're waiting for a bus, and even though the bus has GPS, everyone can only estimate the possible time window of its arrival through "Fermi estimation."

The time conversion of road distance K is affected by rush hour peaks and valleys, holidays, special accidents, and other factors, ultimately causing large models' estimates to only be within a relatively fuzzy range, unable to achieve the precision of subway rail transit.
The time conversion of road distance K has a romantic expression: if you are a beam of light, and we are one light-year apart, then our actual distance might be one year.

Therefore, the problem with traditional physics lies in ignoring time, the most important dimension.

Using time to calculate the length between points has the advantage of reducing "incorrect simulation calculations."
For example, the distance between two Earthlings is currently simulated using spherical formulas, but actually they can contact each other via WeChat, reducing the time needed for displacement.

In this scenario, their "distance" can be greatly shortened, but still cannot obtain a definite value, because no one knows when they will use their phones together.

If you think about the distance between two points from the perspective of displacement, and measure their length using time, you will find that there are countless values.
Because you can choose to walk, ride an electric bike, or use a bus+walking hybrid. Or even both parties remain completely still, never interacting.

But only when others check the surveillance footage do they realize how far apart you actually were.

Surface distance is just an externalized form. **Uncertain temporal distance is the only determinable distance.**
Even whether the other party exists is an illusory concept, because the basis for the other party's existence is based on countless past observations.
But the moment we send a message, we actually cannot determine whether the other side is still alive.

## Conclusion

If love between two people is to last long, why need they stay together night and day?
