## Abstract

On 2025-07-25, I proposed a "gradual shift of temporal fixed points" solution, using the multi-object supervised "[Big Dipper](https://gitee.com/zeusro/seven)" algorithm to peacefully transfer vested interests. But first, we need to have a basic understanding of "temporal fixed points". Only then can we better understand "gradual shift of temporal fixed points".

## Introduction

After completing basketball, I've been learning tennis recently. Since I only have a beginner-level tennis racket, I can only start by learning to wrap grip tape and pick up balls.

## Method

I adopted a master-level grip tape wrapping scheme, keeping a slight angle. After a period of observation, I have basically learned the skill of picking up balls without bending over and basic forehand serving and receiving, and I can also describe part of the concept of "temporal fixed points" in human-understandable language.

### Basic Mathematical Explanation

t'=0

Taking the derivative of time t yields 0. Also called temporal simplification, everything returns to zero.

### Life-like Explanation of Kakutani Fixed Point

No matter how the cup moves, there is always at least one water molecule that remains at the same horizontal position (relative to the ground).

This water molecule is the "temporal fixed point".

### Romantic Literary Explanation

The time point when two destined people meet is their temporal fixed point.

### Infinite Basketball Explanation

In a 1-person-1-ball game against time, the state/instant of human-ball unity is the temporal fixed point.

Regarding temporal fixed points, there is also a corollary: the continuity and discontinuity of temporal fixed points.
Simply put, **discontinuous temporal fixed points are the norm, continuous temporal fixed points are special states**.

## (Dis)continuous Temporal Fixed Points

Life is unsatisfactory, nine times out of ten.

## Conclusion

Don't think too much, just live.
