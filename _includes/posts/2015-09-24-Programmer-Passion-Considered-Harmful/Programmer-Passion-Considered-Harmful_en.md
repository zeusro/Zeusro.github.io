I am not a "passionate programmer." I think that after a fixed 8-hour workday, you should go do something else, like reading science fiction, chatting with my dear wife, etc. When others ask, I'll seriously answer like this: "This is what life is supposed to be. You should try it too."

Actually, I really look down on those passionate programmers. Their so-called passion is spending 12 or even 16 hours a day sitting in front of a computer writing code, or sacrificing their hobbies, sleep, and social interactions for the sake of writing code. Sometimes they don't even have time for basic self-care. This isn't passion—this is clearly an obsession.

## Machismo or Paranoia?

Our culture is messed up. If we're infatuated with a woman and pursue her with the same relentless dedication we use at work, we'd be considered crazy!

However, this kind of madness becomes a role model at work. As long as you can tirelessly and diligently focus on writing code—even if you're severely introverted or have autism—you'll become employers' favorite.

Worse yet, too many male programmers willingly sacrifice their other time for writing code and take pride in it. Then, this work-first trend forces women in high-tech fields to follow suit. Programmers are like masochists—after being beaten, they cheerfully say: "Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

From my experience, the real problem is that programmers who dedicate all their waking hours to work write terrible code that harms both themselves and others.

## Tech Expert Says He's Exhausted

I learned this fundamental truth after a painful experience. This is also why I was fired from an organization that has since dissolved—Conduit Internet Technologies.

Working 12 to 14 hours a day, and if lucky, resting on Sundays. Suddenly one day, management discovered we hadn't done a job well, so capable me was ordered to finish it by the next morning. I had to work through the night.

I worked the entire night. But in the process, I destroyed a database used by the product. Although there was automatic backup, I was too tired—working until 5 AM—so I didn't notice this situation.

I didn't realize my mistake until that afternoon, then immediately started fixing it at home, but management had already cut off remote access. They thought I had completely fixed the database and overwrote it.

...

I didn't deliberately protest, but they still paid me an extra month's salary and allowed me to leave the office after finding a job. How should I put it? This approach was clearly much more lenient than their responsibility assessment in this matter. However, to be honest, I was really exhausted from this job, and being fired felt more like a relief.

## Passion == Suffering

Here's a little anecdote. When employers tell you they value developers' passion, they're actually warning you. When you hear this word, immediately turn around and run, because there's a tiger chasing you.

Many people don't know that the word "passion" is translated from the Greek πάσχειν (paschein), which originally meant "to suffer." Actually, this is the essence of work. But we don't need to suffer for a salary unless you're the CEO. Otherwise, your salary isn't enough to pay for all the bullshit you need to face.

## When Nose Meets Grindstone (Hard Work)

But none of what I said above should be an excuse for slacking off at work. If you're working, work well. Do your eight hours well, then leave immediately. Earn the salary your employer pays you, and that's enough.

How do you earn the salary your employer pays you? Focus, avoid all unnecessary distractions. Get into the zone, write your best code. Avoid meaningless meetings. Avoid doing repetitive work. Use spare time at work to learn new technologies and design patterns, improve your skills. As said in articles like "5 Things That Make Programmers Lose Their Programming Passion," don't frequently do useless work.

Then after eight hours, you can silence your phone and leave the office gracefully. Email, notifications, and voicemail are all left behind. Wait until the next workday to continue working hard, but don't drain yourself dry.

You can do other things: have a drink, daydream, pray, have sex, play with children, walk the dog, scratch the cat's belly, make art, go to a fight club and fight strangers, read, masturbate, make music, or even skydive. Just don't write code.

## It's All Because of Human Nature

You're just a human, not a god, so there's no need to sacrifice yourself and drain yourself to create wealth for capitalists. The more value you create, the more surplus they can get after paying your salary.

Ensuring daily rest time not only provides abundant energy for the next day's work but is also your right. So, rest when you should rest, and don't care about your employer's complaints about your 9-to-5 work hours.

Because these employers won't care about your health and happiness. But health and happiness are the first things we humans should do for ourselves as humans. If your country's culture doesn't say this, then it's lying to you, dear.

What you do in the office is just a means, not an end. If you treat the process as the goal, it will only make you ignore the most beautiful things in life. And if you can't get a chance to breathe, it will only make you gradually hate this job and even despise programming.
