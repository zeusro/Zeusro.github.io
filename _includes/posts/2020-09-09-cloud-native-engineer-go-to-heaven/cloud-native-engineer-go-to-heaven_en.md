The Sphinx is the daughter of the [Hell Two-Headed Dog](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1ODEyNDg3MA==&mid=2655475426&idx=1&sn=46f0e640feae4c4afac374b3928b691e&chksm=f1bf0bcbc6c882dd4159982119c36e091be1d4cf12cd8d9f29f05bc3e38d378f030347ee80a2&mpshare=1&scene=23&srcid=0909hfH7Peo4PyTVSU8U3yyv&sharer_sharetime=1599615406806&sharer_shareid=9b8919de2238b20229856a42c8974cdc#rd). She has a classic riddle called the Riddle of the Sphinx:

> Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?

This riddle of the Sphinx represents the difficulty of self-awareness. Today, I'll try to answer this riddle.

## "Docker Source Code Analysis"

To become an excellent cloud native development engineer, this book is a must-read. Although many designs have been deprecated after Docker containers went through iterations, and the reference value of this book has slightly decreased, you can still learn a **down-to-earth** scholarly approach from it. Under the prevailing trend of superficial tech like "Learn C++ in 21 Days" in China, this book is a breath of fresh air, worth collecting.

If you can get the first edition of this book and get [Sun Hongliang](https://github.com/allencloud)'s signature, the collection value multiplies by N. But the prerequisite is that you have to sell your looks and contribute code to [dragonflyoss](https://github.com/dragonflyoss).

## "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (Third Edition)"

Docker's core underlying technologies include Linux namespaces, control groups, Union file systems, and container formats.

Essentially, container technology depends on Unix systems, so after initially understanding Docker container technology, to continue advancing, you need to understand Unix systems. When tracing many problems to their source, you'll find that the problems come from Unix system design itself.

This book is probably CNCF China Ambassador Zhang Lei's reading material.

## "To Live"

Information technology has a very long learning chain. But after you've learned the basics, stayed up countless nights, and worked countless overtime hours, you can basically gain new knowledge from the following books:

1. "Cervical Spondylosis Rehabilitation Guide"
1. "Daily Care for Lumbar Disc Herniation"
1. "Prevention and Treatment of Heart Disease"
1. "Hypertension Blood Pressure Lowering Guide"
1. "Self-Recovery from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"
1. "Psychiatric Symptomatology"

At this point, you need to read Yu Hua's "To Live." Treating spinal problems is actually quite simple—just practice [backbends](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV197411n7U8). As for other diseases, they can only be solved through more exercise, like jogging, swimming, playing basketball, etc.

When I was still writing `ASP.NET MVC`, there was a Shanghai tycoon with the online name elfy who taught me a lot about C#. Later, I don't know what happened to him, but he fell into the [avalon](https://github.com/RubyLouvre/avalon) pit and became a die-hard fan of [Situ Zhengmei](https://www.cnblogs.com/rubylouvre/), constantly promoting this MVVM framework. Later, I was also dragged into the pit by him.

Our C# package manager is mainly nuget. At that time, I was learning how to reuse old modules, so I helped them with the `av龙` package management.
The address is [avalon](https://www.nuget.org/packages/avalon/2.0.0-beta1).

Situ Zhengmei was a nice person, although I was later removed from the group chat. But I actually quite admire his resume. He wrote a book "[JavaScript Framework Design](https://book.douban.com/subject/27133542/)," and later he made that masterpiece public, putting it on his personal blog for [free download](https://files.cnblogs.com/rubylouvre/JavaScript%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%96%B0.rar).

I remember when he was still a frontend architect at Qunar, one night after drinking a bit, he complained that although Qunar went public and he got some stock, the amount he could sell each year was actually very little, and because it involved foreign exchange, there were currency conversion hassles, which was very troublesome.

His work ability was also widely recognized.

In his blog garden [tags](https://www.cnblogs.com/rubylouvre/tag/), "life" was the least, with only 3 articles.
Perhaps this was the foreshadowing of his untimely death.

To be honest, I don't like consuming the dead. I just hope everyone can **learn from history to understand the rise and fall**.

Often, I can see the flaws of individuals, even the decline of an organization or a city. But when I point this out and try to turn the tide, most people are just **stuck in their pride, refusing to change**.
Then they vent their inner darkness onto me through the internet. When I follow the network cable to find them, I find they're nothing special either.

China is like this—the scum always fight each other. They can never escape the prisoner's dilemma. When they see someone slightly better than them, the only thing they want to do is drag them down to their own stupid level.

Like that classmate Weng Run who transferred to our class in second year of middle school. In second year, when he saw Xiao Huangkai making progress in history, he was very unhappy and publicly led campus bullying, slandering that innocent classmate as a dog and beating him up in the classroom.

Later, he transferred his jealousy to me. Every time he said I cheated on exams. This continued until I got into Yuhuai Middle School. So I later left the group.

The funny thing is, my grades later declined, and once the school organized a free tutoring class, I met him again. At that time, he borrowed a school uniform from Xiaoxu.

During the college entrance exam, he finally got his wish—I ended up at the same school as him.

## "The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch"

The fourth realm is called **all dharmas are empty**. If you've passed through the third realm, your hair is almost gone, and you're not far from becoming a monk.

## "The Turtle, Though Long-Lived"

> Though the divine turtle lives long,
> 
> There comes a time when it must end.
> 
> Though the winged snake rides the mist,
> 
> It turns to dust and ashes in the end.
> 
> An old war-horse may be stabled,
> 
> Yet still it longs to gallop a thousand miles.
> 
> And a noble-hearted man though advanced in years
> 
> Never abandons his proud, aspiring spirit.
> 
> Life's duration, whether long or short,
> 
> Depends not on Heaven alone.
> 
> One who finds happiness in contentment
> 
> Will enjoy a long, long life.

The fifth realm can be simply summarized as: **"Like the sun rising from the east, the great roc spreads its wings, resenting the low sky."**

## Conclusion

> Youth wanders, middle age seeks treasure, old age becomes a monk.
