## My Impression of Chinese Internet

### The Barbaric Era

More than 10 years ago, chat rooms and BBS were popular. Various pirated software, from operating systems down to winrar, many were pirated. Computer hardware was expensive and had low configuration. Dial-up internet, very slow speeds.

### The E-commerce Era

The popularization of high-speed networks and smart devices made information flow faster and faster. When information flows faster, making profits through information asymmetry becomes difficult. In plain language, when we go shopping, we find that the structure of many shopping malls has changed significantly. Core life services (dining, beauty, haircuts, etc.) content is increasing, while other auxiliary content (phones, digital products, appliances, clothing) is decreasing. Those that survive, foot traffic is also precarious. Offline has gradually become a place for subsistence consumption.

Rapid information flow has strangled the survival space of traditional distributors/traditional retailers.

E-commerce development has also gone through a series of stages.

#### Taobao (C-shop) Era

Initially, C-shops were just offline merchants trying something new. Later, offline became increasingly unviable, so these people had to move to pure online. Early C-shops can be simply understood as version 1.0 of Pinduoduo.

#### Tmall (B-shop) Era

As people's living standards improved and brand awareness increased, Chinese e-commerce players also followed this trend, launching Taobao Mall (now called Tmall)/JD Mall, etc.


#### WeChat Commerce Era

E-commerce's epoch-making significance is actually quite many. Besides the "removal of distributors" and "near-infinite information transmission radius" mentioned above, there's also that everyone can participate.

Even though later, as regulatory requirements, Taobao set various rules and thresholds for sellers, it's undeniable that e-commerce continuously attracted people to participate, and the entire mall changed from a blue ocean to a new red ocean.

Everyone is panning for gold, those who make money are definitely those selling shovels. For the vast number of sellers, it's no different. When channel/promotion costs far exceed net profit, they have to rethink life. Some people picked up Pinduoduo. Some found a new approach, using influencers/public account ads to drive traffic to themselves, or becoming influencers themselves, then selling various resources.

By the late WeChat commerce era, these resources were no longer tangible goods. Selling resources became a more ambiguous business method. For example, selling paid courses, bringing ignorant young people into Foxconn to collect referral fees, new product "reviews" (actually just paid articles), air coins, middle-aged anxiety.

To put it harshly, it's scamming/earning IQ tax.

### The Social Network Era

Actually, social networks have always been the main thread of the internet, existing in different forms in different eras.

1. BBS/Chat rooms
2. Blogs/QQ Space
3. Facebook/Weibo
4. Live streaming

Today's social networks have become very decentralized. The consequence of decentralization is the decline of print media and the rise of individual influencers.

Another feature of decentralization is the proliferation of information silos. The rise of communities is somewhat a regression in internet development. They confine information generation and dissemination within their own systems, not open to the entire internet, violating the internet's original intention of openness. This model indirectly led to Baidu Search's decline.

But speaking of Baidu Search, their decline is purely self-inflicted. They pursued short-term financial data, blindly pleasing advertisers, ignoring users' needs for high-value information.

### The Capital Era

```
Capital comes into the world dripping blood and filth from head to toe, from every pore.
```

After so many years of development, some things have evaporated, but capital has settled. Capital, in the form of venture capital, gradually dilutes entrepreneurs' equity, making them ultimately become capital's watchdogs.

Capital's penetration into our lives is extremely extensive, from small things like renting, takeout, fresh food, news, plane tickets, movie tickets, medical beauty, to big things like real estate, finance. Every profitable capillary, capital wants to drill a hole and suck the blood.

Looking at delivery riders risking their lives by going against traffic to meet delivery times, programmers who never see the sunset, beautifully packaged but expensive fruits, apps that publish news in ads, real estate agents who almost help me with down payments, I think this society is really easy to understand, the word "money" is written on everyone's head.

On the surface, we enjoy so-called convenient lives, but in fact we've tacitly allowed the giants' monopolies and incidentally accepted their exploitation.

Wake up, proletarians, your credit cards aren't paid off yet!

## My Vision: Credit Network

An open internet based on credit, not a monopolistic internet based on capital.

This is a broad social vision. A credit-based internet, with openness and credit at its core.

1. Openness: Remove censorship, information transparency.
2. Individual users as first-class citizens of the internet, no longer relying on discrete digital accounts, but a "veiled" credit entity (to ensure personal privacy).
2. Decentralization, enterprises/social organizations/business entities will evolve into independent credit entities.
3. Credit entity credit scores are provided by the core system, no one can modify them.
4. Dynamically score credit entities based on social member evaluations and disputes.

For example, in a daily scenario, I need to find a good restaurant. At this time, I can search for the corresponding restaurant (credit entity) based on "others' evaluations", "personal taste", "distance", then I decide whether to go there to eat.

Scores are all traceable. If I falsely accuse someone, causing their score to drop, then when authoritative institutions arbitrate and find the truth, my score will also drop.

In a society with credit as the foundation, credit will constrain individuals' unreasonable behavior.

When information transmission becomes more effective, social organizations will have new changes, no longer forcing everyone to work in the same office building. Office buildings will become places for holding regular meetings.

Big cities will only retain the functions of transportation hubs and large retail centers.
