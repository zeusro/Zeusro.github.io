Studying computer science at a garbage dump is a truly painful experience. I basically only learned the HTML and database courses, while others were learning just the HTML course—I still remember one day in the library when I found a convenience store receipt stuck in the cracks, filled with love~

Working in computer science in China is really exhausting. Aside from network issues, the textbooks are thick and detached from reality. When you finally enter the industry, there’s a long curve of work and learning. By the time you’re just getting started (with 10 years of experience), you’re already troubled by economic cycles, family issues, and age discrimination. This causes most people to switch careers around the age of 30.

In my personal view, the fundamental reason why China doesn’t have two internet giants is due to the excessive impatience for quick success.

## Business Development & Framework Design

In my opinion, so-called “internet companies” in China merely move offline business scenarios online. Take banks, for example: early domestic banks primarily used manual accounting. Banks were among the first to benefit from computing, but their business models themselves didn’t change much. Except for China Merchants Bank doing relatively well, other banks’ mobile apps are bloated and slow to respond. The change over the past twenty years mostly boils down to successfully ditching IOE (IBM, Oracle, EMC).

But as someone familiar with computer architecture, I know that if I were to take over these legacy projects, I wouldn’t dare to ditch IOE either, because who knows what hardware-specific traps lie inside? (For example, using certain compilation or programming tricks to circumvent hardware architecture flaws, but when porting the program to Linux, these become bugs.)

From the standpoint of business development, our internet transformation has undoubtedly been very successful. In the morning, you can scan a QR code to buy breakfast; step outside and hail a Didi ride; at work, use AI to help fabricate nonsense; order takeout at noon; pay for snacks with face recognition in the afternoon; and in the evening, head straight to a booked entertainment venue to keep the party going.

As long as you have money, one smartphone lets you travel nationwide. But the programming frameworks used have basically nothing to do with us. Although many top projects are now led by Chinese people, programming frameworks themselves are a money-losing business.  
Many people work in this field purely to escape poverty, and most people (myself included) have no respect for intellectual property and no habit of paying for it.  
Everyone just enjoys others’ free labor without valuing their time.

## Open Source Development & Language Design

Technical frameworks are essentially convenience toolkits. Because programming languages only implement basic standards, open source technical frameworks are needed to build the language’s ecosystem.

A programming language is like a “brush,” and open source technical frameworks are the “calligraphy works” painted by this brush. They complement each other.  
Take Python, a low-performance, dynamically typed language. I don’t particularly like its language design, but I can’t deny that frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are written in Python.

Python’s performance optimization direction surprisingly involves bypassing the GIL and using C. This feels somewhat like a case of missing the forest for the trees.

It’s like I brought a flyer advertising a beautiful masseuse, but was greeted by a burly man who told me the beauty was resting and that he was stronger and better suited for massage work. My mind and body rejected this because it completely contradicted my original intention.

AI has found its way, Python ascends.

## Language Design & Operating System

Programming languages are a deep field of study. Control flow, machine code translation, abstract syntax trees, GC, threads, compiler theory—all these are so complex that I can barely solve 1+1.

Computing is also a frustrating industry. Gifted kids learn HTML in fourth or fifth grade and start programming robots and building rockets; meanwhile, I was just registering a QQ account on a relative’s computer and getting crushed in Bubble Trouble by classmates.

Not to mention the terrible environment in domestic universities: professors try hard to get tenure, only to be found teaching with decade-old tutorials and saying, “Actually, learning C# 2005 is enough. Even with .NET Core now, it’s basically the same~”

I’m truly amazed. One is a platform-specific language; the other is a next-generation language supporting cross-platform and even cross-language compilation. How can these be the same? The most important first step in learning programming is participating in open source project design. Understanding industrial design processes, rather than waiting for rescue on the Titanic.

Programming languages rely on operating systems, which serve as their carriers. Operating systems are the bridge between hardware and software. They are the highest mountain in software development.

## Software Development & Integrated Circuits

In fact, business development, open source framework design, programming language design, and operating system development can all be categorized as “software development.” From this perspective, our internet industry still has a large blank space.

Treating people as consumables means accepting traffic fluctuations and instability during work handovers. Not to mention platform users can launch “redirect attacks”—abandoning those harsh “internet platform companies” that mistreat employees.

So-called agile development in China is just manpower pushing carts (and three people pushing a four-wheeled new energy vehicle at that). The Mythical Man-Month describes this “pregnant woman giving birth” trick—one woman takes 40 weeks to give birth, but you can’t schedule 10 women to deliver in 4 weeks. I have seen so many “all-nighter” projects, all ending in abandonment or rework.

The time and energy wasted chasing quick wins are negligible compared to the “time saved,” and if technical vulnerabilities result, the losses are even greater.

The upstream of software development is integrated circuits. We do have a good fund supporting high-tech integrated circuit industries. But resources are repeatedly misallocated, and money doesn’t flow to truly national and people-serving enterprises and individuals.

Software development and integrated circuits should be industries of steady accumulation and theory-practice integration. Instead, university research almost prides itself on scamming funds (e.g., calling advisors “bosses”);  
private enterprises, under the guise of youthfulness, harvest middle-aged workers like crops, causing experienced senior developers to lose jobs, all while praising this as “delivering talent to society.”

## Two styles of swords

This is like the dispute between the Sword Sect and Qi Sect of Mount Hua. After the Sword Sect (the younger faction) took power, they kicked out Qi Sect practitioners (senior developers). Because Sword Sect practices yield fast results, are sure to profit, and have cheap labor.

The Sword Sect focuses on heavy sword techniques, while the Qi Sect (open source projects, language design, operating systems) emphasizes internal cultivation.  
Neither is right or wrong. In youth, practicing sword techniques with borrowed manuals (Go, C#, Java) is fine. But most people just use one language for 4-5 years and then call themselves senior developers, which is basically copying 50 lines of code for 4-5 years.

Or they become Java boys who forcibly implement microservices without need, just to ease the next job hunt.

This is just a poor imitation. True internal skill (internet protocols, coding standards, abstract modeling ability) has not been properly accumulated. When the “sword” rusts (e.g., PHP falls out of favor, projects get crushed by competitors), they’re forced to switch careers, wasting their martial arts.

The “Qi” in Qi Sect is not arrogance but a kind of survival confidence. This confidence is a ten-year daily effort, persistent, and enduring. It is the courage to move toward the tiger’s den even when the whole world doubts you and you have no sword in hand.

We need ideals because, in the long dark night, only hope can carry us far.
