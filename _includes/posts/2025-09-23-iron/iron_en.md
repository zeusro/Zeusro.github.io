Steel is widely used in housing construction, industrial machinery, home appliances, and kitchenware. For example, our Shantou TV Tower was rated as “Excellent Steel Tower Design and High‑Quality Construction” in 1990. It was also the tallest TV tower in the country at that time.

## The Golden Age of Television Media

TV channels in our childhood were truly fun to watch. Every afternoon from 16:00 to 17:45, TVB broadcast various children’s programs. School ended earlier in Hong Kong, so sometimes when I walked home, I would miss the Cantonese‑dubbed anime that started at 5 p.m. In Hong Kong back then, most locally produced content was films and TV dramas, while anime was mainly imported from Japan.

But not all Hong Kong and Taiwan programs were “high‑quality”. There was a series of films teaching people to quit smoking, stay healthy, and stay far away from gambling, drugs, and crime.  
Kids in our slum neighborhood got those DVDs through “special channels”, studied them day and night, and then copied the behavior — chasing down weaker students and bullying them in school.

Among those who participated in campus bullying:  
Some were persuaded to drop out in primary school,  
some did not finish junior high,  
some finished vocational school,  
and only a few completed high school or college.

## Soviet‑style Primary School in the Slum

Our primary school building was Soviet‑style. Student quality was poor, and the teachers were no better.

Our Chinese teacher was like an oversized baby, always biting a feeding bottle. Her teaching method was cutting out newspaper articles and reading them. If you raised a new perspective she could not refute, she would accuse you of being “too extreme”, and force you to copy the newspaper text repeatedly until you “understood”.

The art teacher was a guy with pockmarks and fierce eyes — nicknamed “Street Fighter”. Faced with us little monsters, he refused to back down and was always ready to fight. He often put us through military‑style drills. Girls had it slightly better, but almost all the boys suffered under him.

His teaching method: spend the first five minutes explaining what to draw, and then demand absolute silence. If anyone made a sound, that student must stand up and slap themselves, and remain standing until the class ended.

As the smallest and weakest kid, I learned to walk to and from school alone by the 4th or 5th grade. I sat straight, listened carefully — yet I still could not escape Street Fighter’s torment.  
He peeked at my notebook without permission and read one of my essays aloud to the whole class — everyone laughed. I bent over the floor in pain, ballpoint pen ink spilling everywhere.

Our bottle‑biting teacher actually showed a bit of kindness and comforted me.  
Street Fighter later restrained himself — because a 6th‑grade senior beat him up during PE class. Yes, I saw him pinned to the corridor floor and punched.

**Young without fear——cross the great wall and find the truth;using words as weapons, killing evil and defending justice**

## *Can fate be escaped?*

When entering junior high, there were N admission slots to Fei Xia Middle School. Based on grades, I was exactly the N+1/2 student — so I went to the worst school, Aihua Middle School. I accepted it calmly.

One of my female classmates missed the cutoff by just a point or two and also ended up with me in Aihua. Later during the college entrance exam, she cried again.

College entrance exams are usually held in summer:  
**Life is short,I use Python.**  

Applied to her:  
She studied desperately from primary to high school, working so hard she ignored the terrifying difficulty of Gaokao in Guangdong. With a score for a low‑tier university, she could only enter a junior college. In the end, she could only lament life’s bitterness and summer’s length.

## Money never lies

Back when we lacked access to information, my study method in junior high was stupid:  
For liberal arts, I memorized the entire textbook;  
For science, I relied on doing exercises and asking teachers.

My favorite teacher wasn’t actually my math teacher or homeroom teacher — it was Physics Teacher Jiang.

Although the homeroom teacher and the math teacher helped me apply for scholarships and financial aid, I disliked moral politics, because I am not a “moral person”.

In the second half of 7th grade, I invented a new method to prove a math problem and texted it to my math teacher. He was shocked and mentioned it in class. Soon after, through “checking water meters”, he identified me and became extremely curious about me.

He then checked my math book without permission and became furious when he saw the four characters **“Studying alone leads to narrowness”** on the title page.  
He ordered me to cover it with correction tape, and punished me to stand outside after school from 17:15 to around 18:15.

But those four characters were my reflection after reading *An Ode to the Humble Room* — reminding myself to be open‑minded, to look beyond shallow scores, and to seek the essence behind all phenomena.

I had two classmates, one boy and one girl:
- The boy wasted my time for a year, then secretly transferred after 7th grade — and kept deceiving me online afterward.
- The girl was purely a parasite — clinging to me in junior high, then switching “male hosts” in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.

To be honest — the parasite looked pretty good. Unlike *Zhai Xinxin*, she didn’t cause anyone’s death. Ironically, such selfish people ended up studying at good universities like Guangxi University of Finance and Economics.

From their life experiences, I refined the essence:  
**Money never lies.**

Next time I meet them, I hope they repay the phone bill they owe my family. Thanks!

## My destiny is in my hands

Back to me. Even though in junior high I still walked to school alone most of the time —  
**The human heart is more terrifying than a tsunami.**  

When your grades surpass the teacher’s, even the teacher gets jealous.

By 9th grade, I could look at any math problem and instantly know the answer.  
The math teacher finally chose to spare me — since I was his “achievement”.  
My workbook was basically blank; I flipped through it only for fun.

A major “student loss” happened when the transfer boy left — so the school split the most troublesome Class One and distributed the students to other classes.

The leader of the beggar gang, **Marco B‑ro**, was one of them.  
He became obsessed with Japanese pop culture early in primary school. In 8th grade, he intentionally discussed every detail of anime near me with another “hobbit”, even criticizing actors and current events.

His jealousy never stopped.  
All throughout junior high and high school, he insisted I cheated.  
After graduation, he even created a chat group just to attack me.

Ironically, a charity cram school run by Yuhua Middle School allowed him to audit classes — so he met me again there.

His school uniform was borrowed from **Hong**, who also participated in cyberbullying a student nicknamed “Dog‑brother”. Hong later became a doctor and played Rubik’s cube in his free time.

We all watched *Fullmetal Alchemist* and understood psychology — how meaningful busyness can mask sadness.

---

So here’s a question:  
What is meaningful busyness?  
And what is meaningless busyness?

Meaningless busyness is Marco’s — bullying others out of jealousy.  
One day after school, he locked both classroom doors and beat a student with a “dog‑beating stick”.

He is merely a narcissist craving attention — sneaking phones to school only to get them stolen twice.  
I wonder if his rusty gasoline motorcycle has been scrapped now.  
He made me feel like I was living in my grandfather’s era.

Meaningful busyness is: doing sports, reading, gaming to connect with the world,  
and writing to refine thinking.  

```poem
Having scaled the Five Great Mountains, I still tread muddy paths at night;
Majesty behind me, hardship beneath me — the journey is far from done.
```

“Now I know grief’s taste too well — yet hesitate to speak.”  
Making soup at home, saying: “This typhoon is truly a great autumn wind.”

## Conclusion

Steel is never made by simply refining iron.  
A will of steel is forged through countless sleepless nights, hammered ruthlessly by fate —  **Never giving up yourself, always moving forward** .

Only after abandoning distractions can one earn the title of **“Fullmetal Alchemist”**.

A thousand strikes cannot break its strength — steel forged by a hundred refinements can cut through the wind
