On September 6, 2025, I proposed the concept of "[Time Series Complexity](https://www.zeusro.com/2025/09/06/time-series-complexity/)". On the basis of time complexity and space complexity, this completes the puzzle of measuring function computational efficiency.

## Preface

Many computer science nerds like to think and analyze problems according to traditional computer definitions. But they don't recognize that problems themselves come from life.

Therefore, through the very simple example of mayfly mating, we can explain the concept of "time series complexity."

## Aerial Mating of Mayflies

Grasping: After the male successfully approaches the female, he uses his slender forelegs to tightly grasp the female's thorax.

Position adjustment: The male then bends the long claspers at the end of his abdomen, firmly gripping the end of the female's abdomen.

Connection: At this point, the two mayflies present a "male on top, female below" tandem position, flying together.

Insemination: During connected flight, the male's penis connects with the female's spermathecal opening, injecting the spermatophore (sperm sac) into the female. The entire mating process is completed entirely in flight, lasting from a few seconds to several minutes.

## 3 Seconds, Real Man

Assuming it only lasts 3 seconds, then the horizontal axis interval of this function is [0,3], where 0 is a relative instantaneous concept, representing "now."

After 3 seconds, `free -m` returns to zero, meaning "not a drop left."

From a purely temporal perspective, their mating process is quite efficient. But if we replace it with my good neighbors, I generally recommend they see a urologist.

If their partners aren't too ugly, I might consider taking care of them as well.

## Conclusion

Mayfly wings, elegant and graceful. My heart is troubled, where do I return?
