## Abstract

On May 20, 2020, I published the ultimate theology that shook heaven and earth, "[God-Theory](https://github.com/zeusro/God-Theory)", which expanded the concept of players and proposed the P Equilibrium.

## Introduction

In 2020, I was thinking about how to make both the rich lady and young and beautiful notice me playing skateboard handsomely at the same time.
The program was half-written at that time, but considering that golang doesn't have convenient methods like linq for multi-generic intersection, I didn't feel like writing it.

## Method

After 5 years of serious slacking off, and sleeping while working, I finally found the proof method for the P Equilibrium of the multiverse.

The P Equilibrium of the multiverse mainly proves the existence of temporal fixed points. Temporal fixed points are a superset of fixed points in the narrow three-dimensional world.

In romantic literary terms, after a long passage of time, two people destined to meet will encounter each other.

I still use the original approach: build a huge loop and directly brute force enumerate.

## Discussion

To simplify the problem and reduce computational load, I limited the calculation model's location to the circular runway inside Xinyan Garden in Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, using traditional displacement formulas as calculation formulas.

I call it the [Sea Eye Algorithm](https://github.com/zeusro/system/blob/main/function/local/p/v3/sea_eye.go).

As long as I keep wandering between the rich lady and young and beautiful, I believe one day I will definitely find that rich lady who is both rich and beautiful.

## Conclusion

```poem
身无彩凤双飞翼
心有灵犀一点通

No money to marry two wives
I only love you on this moment

Yesterday's star,last windy night
The law does not allow me to take two wives
So I can't fuck your mother as my wife
```
