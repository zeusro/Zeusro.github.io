Recommendation algorithms can now be seen in many fields, such as e-commerce shopping, news and information, travel and entertainment, and social media.

## E-commerce Shopping

Any e-commerce platform will have this "You May Like" advertising, which is actually generated based on past search records and extracted tags.

But there's a `bug` here. If after a period of time, my enthusiasm wanes, continuing to push related products will only make me feel annoyed. And I found that even if I eventually buy, it will still continue to push related products for a while. I think this logic is strange.

What's even more annoying is that their recommendations are platform-wide. As long as you leave your activity traces on a large platform, you will see corresponding ad pushes in any of their products. That's why the web has needs like `Do Not Track`.

A better algorithm should only extract the search records of users who haven't purchased, and push related products during the "impulse period". If already purchased, it should stop pushing to avoid duplicate consumption.

## News and Information

The recommendation algorithm for news and information is simple and crude. Toutiao (ByteDance) does this most typically: it will tag you based on browsing history, and subsequent pushes are all this type of news.

The `bug` here is that **based on just a little past fixed impression, a subjective judgment of a person can be constructed**, which will actually deepen a person's cognitive bias.

For example, if you like to watch domestic military news like "Dongfeng Express, Mission Must Arrive", over time, you will feel that your country is exceptionally strong. But actually, without comparison, there's no harm.

"The Celestial Empire is rich in products and has everything, and originally did not need foreign goods to exchange." Doesn't this sentence seem ironic now?

## Social Media

This example is played to the extreme in fan circles. Platforms intentionally or unintentionally bring together groups of people with common tags to discuss some rambling questions based on common interests and hobbies.

Someone said you should use your left foot to brake. Then he extensively searched and deeply participated in such topics on Zhihu. After that, the platform will continuously push similar content. From the platform's perspective, although users' stay time has increased, using the left foot to brake is purely nonsense.

My main personality is INTP, and Zhihu often pushes me information about the same personality type. Although it was interesting at first, I later felt this violated my original intention of searching for effective information.

Later I deconstructed myself again and reconsidered why I would have the emotional fluctuation of "feeling interesting". I think it's because there's still something called "sociality" in my soul. Zhihu used my loneliness, used my potential need to know people of the same personality type, tagged me and targeted me with such messages.

I call this phenomenon "**digital domestication**".

## Summary

Recommendation algorithms are essentially a lever. Their biggest bug is that they exploit people's laziness and amplify the dark side of human nature. They cater to people's laziness, making these people's hearts narrower and narrower.

Perhaps human free will will eventually be enslaved by machines and algorithms, but this is actually the evil fruit brought by human laziness itself.
