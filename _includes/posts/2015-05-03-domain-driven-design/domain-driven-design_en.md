After reading <ASP.NET Design Patterns>, I had an epiphany. It turns out that my previous coding habits were called transaction scripts, active record, and query objects.

I'm still quite accustomed to the three-layer architecture or its variants. However, I discovered later that maintaining a large project is really painful. With transaction scripts, there's a situation where I need to modify a feature, but I don't know which specific class or method corresponds to this feature. As for active record, when it involves sequential operations across multiple tables, it feels a bit strange. It feels like this method shouldn't be placed here, but I don't know where else to put it.

What I understand about Domain-Driven Design is a modeling philosophy. This philosophy places method organization within domain objects. Domain objects, to me, are abstract named types. For example, consumers, service providers, orders, and various objects in interaction diagrams. For instance, there's a banker domain object, a proletariat domain object. When the proletariat borrows money from a bank, there's a borrowing method in the proletariat class. The parameters of this method include the banker object and some required "procedures". Personally, I don't like making domain models too anemic, because many properties need to be injected during instantiation. What if there are too many methods? But I will still add the necessary primary key id.

So the main body of this borrowing method is nothing more than: I need to judge whether borrowing is legal based on these procedures. The data source is not obtained within this method but is passed as a parameter. So where is the data source written? It's written in the repository interface within the domain service. This way, there's no problem. When business changes, we only need to modify this borrowing method. If other procedures are needed? I think I'll consider making "procedures" an attribute of the borrower at that time.
