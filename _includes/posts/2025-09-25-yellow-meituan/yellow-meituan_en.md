I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. 
That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody. 
If anybody wanted to tell me something, they'd have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. 
They'd get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I'd be through with having conversations for the rest of my life.

On August 27, 2025, Meituan released its Q2 financial report. The report showed that Meituan's Q2 revenue was 91.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 11.7%. Adjusted net profit was 1.49 billion yuan, a year-on-year decline of 89%. Affected by competition, both Meituan and JD.com saw significant declines in net profit in Q2.

Meituan CEO Wang Xing described the food delivery industry as "wringing water from a towel"—I think this description is very apt. Revenue is high, but net profit margin is less than 2%.

As an 11-year veteran user who registered with Meituan 4,188 days ago, I still remember when Meituan was mainly focused on group buying. Baidu Food Delivery entered and then exited, and Ele.me was just so-so. Only Meituan has persevered so diligently for so long.

Many people have a poor overall impression of food delivery riders, but they don't realize that **Meituan Food Delivery is actually a socialized labor reform camp**. They have also been bearing huge social pressure, to the point that Wang Xing's Fanfou account has self-silenced.

Meituan Food Delivery's company office address is something you'll never find 🤣. In my super-magical realist novel, I call Meituan the "Quanzhen Sect."

## Fanfou

I also have a Fanfou account. Back in 2010, I met YY, Xiaori, and Chen Xiaozhi online as alumni of Yuhua Middle School. The internet environment back then was far from what it is now, full of telecom fraud and course sales.
They were two grades ahead of me, and around January 2011, they came to visit me as a group and gave me some study materials.

But back then, I was obsessed with *The Catcher in the Rye* and couldn't handle the academic pressure, so I often skipped class.

I'm grateful that I actively slept in class back then, knowing nothing about physics, chemistry, or biology, which allowed me to "forge a sword over ten years," converting all the detours I took into time, and using this to perfect [quantum theory](github.com/zeusro/quantum).

Someone like me who values freedom—if I had been born in a different country, I'd now be teaching at Princeton, winning a Fields Medal, and a Nobel Prize in Physics would be more than enough. I wouldn't be stuck at the bottom of society like now, fighting with all sorts of demons for those few scraps.

Every time I see those so-called "elders" lying to my face, thinking a few nice words can send me away, treating me like a minor with their condescending attitude, I really want to laugh.

Meituan Food Delivery is quite sensible—regular customers get rewards for quality suggestions. Not long ago, I even bought a 10+ yuan "Pin Hao Fan" in three installments.

## Meituan Food Delivery Algorithm Model Optimization

Coastal small cities are frequently hit by typhoons and storms in summer. For a tiny place like Shantou's Jinping District, which can be walked across in a day, increasing the proportion of flash purchases would be more appropriate.

The previous food delivery subsidy wars had a problem: some gray/black market operations would collude between merchants and buyers to cheat subsidies. Later, Meituan Food Delivery likely solved part of the problem by improving processes, GPS positioning, and keeping trajectory records.

With current big data statistical algorithms, extracting features to determine whether merchants and buyers are colluding to cheat subsidies isn't that difficult anymore. We're already in postmodernism, preparing to enter the posthuman stage—gray/black market operations can't be completely eliminated.

But for small cities like Shantou, where old walk-up buildings are very common and delicious food is everywhere, if food delivery could provide an **extreme weather food delivery to pickup** option, with delivery fees transferred to merchants.
This would both save delivery rider resources and be convenient for tourists/residents who like to walk.

With reduced delivery rider commission, more can be invested in ingredients, better rewarding customers and forming a virtuous cycle.

## The Conflict Between Restaurants and Meituan Food Delivery

I think many restaurants have strange ways of thinking. They always complain that food delivery platforms' commission rates are too high. If you think it's high, you can exit. Like some ten-year-old restaurants in our area, they only do food delivery because customers need it, don't pay a penny in advertising fees, and still have customers.

Food ingredients not selling, prices can't go up, relying on cutting corners and making pre-made dishes—this kind of garbage restaurant in Shantou deserves to be shot 🤣.

McDonald's, as a benchmark for China's pre-made food industry, survives here only through air conditioning and toys.

## Git Gud

What's the use of good grades? I learned better than the teacher in middle school, and the teacher still got jealous.

As a slacker in high school, barely surviving in the "crossfire," I was also very anxious before the college entrance exam and called our chemistry teacher, Lao Cai.

Teacher Cai Cifeng said helplessly: "You have to believe in yourself ~~(you who scored 1 point on a test)~~, you'll be fine."

Sister Feng has taught so many students, knows that everyone has their own fate, and wouldn't make things difficult for me just because of my poor grades.
