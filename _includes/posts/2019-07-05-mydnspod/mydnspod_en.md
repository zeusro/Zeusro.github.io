## Background Information

I complained to them through Tencent Cloud about my dissatisfaction, and they told me to press `ctrl + ` to zoom the page. As a veteran keyboard warrior, who can tolerate this?

DNSPod's 770px wide domain configuration page really disgusted me. I decided to make it longer.

In a fit of anger, I decided to do it myself, using the Tampermonkey plugin to widen the entire page.

## Familiarize with Tampermonkey Plugin Development

You can refer to [this](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/help/meta-keys)

It's roughly the same as native JavaScript, just with a few more constraints and syntax

## Distribution

## Follow-up Prank

I saw on the DNSPod website that they were [recruiting](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_VDth24K8HPzsbbwMIQZAw). I decided to be mischievous and send an email to `hr@dnspod.com`🤡.

`2019-10-17` Update: They recently switched to a new version, so the project has been frozen.
