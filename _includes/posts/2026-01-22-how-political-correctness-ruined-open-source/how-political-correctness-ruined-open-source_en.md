# How Political Correctness Ruined the Open Source Community

## ❌master ✅ main

master/slave is a long-standing master-slave architecture in computing. Through the separation of master and slave, distributed reading and failover are achieved. However, during the Black Lives Matter movement, GitHub announced plans in June 2020 to oppose the use of terms that might carry associations with slavery, and on October 1, 2020, the default branch name for new repositories was changed to "main".

## Moral Police

A major manifestation of political correctness in the open source community is the various moral police. Many Chinese developers use their limited time to develop open source software, only to have their projects flooded with various issues, constantly dealing with "stupid questions" about stupid problems. Like how to install this software, or how to fix errors when something goes wrong.

They don't even have time to look at where the error stack trace starts, always taking it for granted to waste others' time. Then they treat others' selfless contributions as "open source spirit".

Or they bring completely unrelated ideologies into the open source community, such as LGBT.

The popularity of LGBT culture in the open source community is, in my opinion, a historical regression. It's like the female fighters in China, who leverage the gender advantage of there being more men than women to make all kinds of outrageous statements.

But when you examine their theoretical foundation, it's a black hole. Their ultimate demands are nothing more than asking for more money before marriage, preventing the other party from transferring assets during marriage, splitting the other party's assets after divorce, or being petty about trivial matters (like demanding others to be environmentally friendly while constantly wasting food themselves), and extracting "emotional value" from the other party through various so‑called "tests of feelings". In this regard, China and the West have achieved perfect unity.

## Black Lives Matter & LLM Parasites

Moral police were particularly evident during the Black Lives Matter movement. I remember that at the end of 2020, when viewing Kubernetes web documentation, there suddenly appeared BLM support advertisements.

Looking at the history, it was added by #25173 [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25173/files](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25173/files). But later on Jan 8, 2021, [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25769](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/25769), it was removed, and the reason for removal was very vague, as if it never existed.

Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of the BLM movement, resigned from her position as executive director of BLMGNF in 2021. Tax documents showed that she did not receive a salary during the fiscal year, but served as an "unpaid volunteer." However, her associated companies and family members received large sums of money: her brother Paul Cullors' company (Cullors Protection or Black Ties LLC) received approximately $840,000 for "professional security services" (2022 tax documents). Total income since 2021 has exceeded $4.2 million.

Cullors was also accused of using the fund to purchase a mansion in Los Angeles worth approximately $6 million for a "black creative space."

Other co-founder and board member Shalomyah Bowers' company received $2.1 million in consulting fees.

Former board member Raymond Howard and his sister's company received approximately $1.1 million.

Two former employees received settlement payments: one former board member $400,000, and another $335,000 (2023).

As time passed, we discovered that those who supported this movement were the real clowns. Behind the BLM movement, the only ones who actually benefited were the organizers' income and mansions, not the ideals of the movement itself. Being able to exchange the consumption of the dead for such great benefits is something only this kind of capitalist country can achieve. All talk of justice, everything is business.

Their income has nothing to do with the Kubernetes project. It reminds me of those parasitic classmates in middle and high school, who only think about wasting your resources to achieve their own goals.

It's like the previous [https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). Current LLM-assisted programming tools can integrate into users' projects without them even reading the documentation. [https://github.com/zeusro/tool](https://github.com/zeusro/tool) This project of mine integrates tailwindcss using Cursor.

To be honest, this makes me a bit horrified. On one hand, developers work diligently, projects get more and more stars, and users keep increasing; however, the reality is that these virtual accolades cannot cover the team's daily expenses, and even basic survival becomes a problem.

## My Thoughts

I realized back in 2020 that the Kubernetes project actually has nothing to do with Chinese people. The main initiators of the project are people from Google Cloud, so if your work relationship doesn't belong to Google Cloud, they basically won't accept your pull requests. This perfectly explains why the LGBT banner appeared in the kubernetes/website project.

CRD is a Kubernetes resource, and CR and controller are downstream of CRD. Therefore, no matter how good the deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet controllers implemented by third parties (openkruise) are, merging them upstream into Kubernetes will probably never happen in our lifetime.

I myself have long been blacklisted by the Kubernetes organization, but I don't give a damn.

As a Chinese developer, I think everyone should actually think about a question: If we always wait for a savior to arrive before taking action, then is it possible that this world has never had any gods or emperors, and there is no so-called savior?

We always fall into a passive mindset of imitators, unwilling to be the first to eat the crab. Instead, we wait until the project matures before thinking about getting a piece of the pie, but they simply don't play with us.

The political struggles in the open source world are far more brutal than we imagine. Beneath the peace and openness, there are actually undercurrents.

For open source projects developed by individuals and startup teams, I actually won't make any comments - if you don't like it, don't use it. After all, it's already quite difficult for them to spend time developing; but for units with listed company backgrounds, I think the vision should be longer-term, the posture should be lower first, and they should first establish themselves based on the situation where domestic makeshift teams and small and micro enterprises are the majority, and think clearly about the target customer group for the project's purpose.

Instead of holding million-dollar annual salaries all day, writing code that makes no sense, unable to even explain the ROI of resource usage and marginal benefits to small bosses who like zero-cost shopping.

## White Lives Matter

If Kubernetes doesn't change, then I will change Kubernetes.

![Yellow Lives Matter](/img/in-post/how-political-correctness-ruined-open-source/yellow-lives-matter.gif)

I have decided to use [https://github.com/p-program/kube-killer](https://github.com/p-program/kube-killer) and [https://github.com/Z-Nightmare/kuberneteskuberneteskubernetes](https://github.com/Z-Nightmare/kuberneteskuberneteskubernetes) as starting points to launch a White Lives Matter movement on the global internet, protesting against the Kubernetes organization's national discrimination and moral bias.
