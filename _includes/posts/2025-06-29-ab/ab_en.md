## Geographic Interpretation of N-Dimensional Line Segments

In the article "[Old Turtle](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zYhGgyx_HQV0qHsyTf_96Q?token=2125660481&lang=zh_CN)," I compared Guangzhou City to a turtle.
In my view, cities themselves have life, and their growth process is itself an N-dimensional line segment produced by "a point changing over time."

Using objects to metaphorize people, human development is actually like a city or an animal—don't care about temporary gains and losses, the key is to learn lessons from failures and cherish the beauty before you when successful.

The speed of time is a personal feeling; the key is to find the route that suits you.

## Mate Selection Interpretation of N-Dimensional Line Segments

In the article "[Should Girls Get on the Young Master's Supercar](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UuiRsbPmb8KksyJ9eocKQw),"
I pointed out that shortcuts visible to the naked eye are often not the best strategy.

At this point, I have to bring up the example of when I first arrived in Shenzhen and mistakenly entered the [Spider Cave](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fklt2QDYWE5g3Bs_ZF6aIQ).
At that time, I was just bursting the fantasy of little spiders trying to catch a rich husband.

```
Feeding meat to a tiger—if the tiger doesn't eat, fine; if it eats, it will devour all
Man is the knife and board, I am the fish and meat
Better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes than to moisten each other with spit
```

## Mathematical Interpretation of N-Dimensional Line Segments (P=NP)

In my recently published multidimensional universe conjecture (https://github.com/zeusro/math/blob/main/n/ab.md), I explained N-dimensional line segments by extending the original mathematical definition.

[The measurement standard for line segment length should be time](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1ODEyNDg3MA==&mid=2655476198&idx=2&sn=69a3b56040b90558b2d9a6f020efc64d&chksm=f1bf04cfc6c88dd9e18b476b2b86b8361a87aa0725a6c509982426e16ee82759d44015ac33cb&scene=178&cur_album_id=1501795090070077441&search_click_id=#rd).

As early as 2020, I compared the Guangzhou Metro to a "drainage system" and designed a "commute parkour" game (the person with the shortest commute time wins).
For the walking problem, I summarized the strategy as "Lingbo Weibu" (Lightness Skill).

In N-dimensional spacetime, finding your own "line segment" that takes the shortest time and doesn't collide with people is the N-dimensional line segment.

"Lingbo Weibu" is the answer to solving the Millennium Problem (P=NP).

## Programmatic Interpretation of N-Dimensional Line Segments (P≠NP)

I implemented 2 algorithms using [golang](https://github.com/zeusro/system/tree/main/problems/np), basically all suboptimal solutions based on greedy search.

But through the definition of generalized game theory, I believe that in the current programming environment, only suboptimal solutions can be obtained; the global optimal solution (P=NP) does not exist.

## Extended Game Theory Interpretation of N-Dimensional Line Segments

In [Generalized Game Theory](https://github.com/zeusro/math/blob/main/game/readme.zh.md),
I pointed out that "global optimal solution" and "relative optimal solution" are relative; strictly speaking, "global optimal solution" does not exist.

In generalized game theory, the world is an infinitely large chessboard, and you can choose any goal as the "game object," such as your own and others' fates.

In the traveling salesman problem, the game rule is to play against time, finding the path in the shortest time. Therefore, greedy search becomes the solution closest to optimal among all solutions.

## Calculation Formula for N-Dimensional Line Segment Distance—Banana Algorithm

When accompanying Tang Sanzang to the West to obtain scriptures in 2017, I encountered a gay man.

That person studied design and really liked elements related to bananas. One day during lunch break, he suddenly said to me: "You must be a very interesting person, let's add WeChat."

Not long after adding, without my consent, he sent pictures from my WeChat Moments to a girl, causing me to be sprayed with water by her around April 2017.

Later, he slunk into the Amoeba Group, and through my efforts, I finally made him fail the probation period.

I recently combined this banana element and designed a [banana algorithm](https://github.com/zeusro/system/blob/main/function/local/n/ab_test.go) to calculate N-dimensional line segments.

I will turn all those who maliciously mocked, insulted, and cursed me into code and test cases, making them experience eternal scorn and ridicule.

## Conclusion

    Mountains and rivers repeat, no road in sight; willows dark, flowers bright, another village ahead
