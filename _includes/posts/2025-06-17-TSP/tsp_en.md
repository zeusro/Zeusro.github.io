## golang proves P=NP

xyz is the special case in n universe.

```txt
1:t=0
2:x=x && y=y && z=z && 1=1
But we are actually living in the n universe.
```

In the n universe:

```txt
1:t≠0
2:1=n ⇔ n=1
3:P=P ⇔ P=NP
1=n,n=1,P=NP reduces to P=P.So the P=NP problem could be solved.
```

For example:

1=n : I am one of the humans.

n=1 : “Compress” all the data to 1.

```go
type N struct {
    Sky            
    Ground         
    YoungAndBeautiful 
    Others          
}
```

## Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Problem: A salesman needs to visit multiple cities, each exactly once, and return to the starting point. Given the distances between each pair of cities, the question is: Is there a path whose total length does not exceed K?

Answer: In fact, the formulation of this problem is flawed. The actual problem should be framed as finding the fastest path. Since time is considered as the one-dimensional world, the problem can be transformed: it doesn’t matter which city you start from. As long as you always go to the next nearest city after arriving at the current one, the problem becomes solvable as a greedy search for the shortest path.

For the TSP problem, the length measurement standard should be time, not distance in the intuitive sense.

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the shortest path between two points is a straight line.

In n dimensions, a segment does not necessarily follow a 3D straight line.

In N-dimensional space, the length of a segment is measured based on time, not distance.

An N-dimensional line segment is a special case at t = 0 in 3D space. Because it lacks the dimension of time, it becomes a 3D line segment — what we intuitively understand as “the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.”

In dimensions higher than three, the criterion for measuring the length of a line segment is time — the segment with the shortest duration is the shortest N-dimensional line segment.

I think I have proved P=NP problem from math.

Other 20%,time will tell.


The 3D world is just a point when t = 0 (𝑑𝑛⁄𝑑𝑡 = 0)

The 3D world is just a point in n universe——a special case at t = 0.

In my n-dimensional math hypothesis , t constantly shifts, so n = 1 and n ≠ 1 hold at once.

This seems paradoxical in 3D, but not in n.
