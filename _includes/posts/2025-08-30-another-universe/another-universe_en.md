A creature walks on four legs in infancy, two legs in youth, and three legs in middle and old age. What is this creature?

My answer is: a man. Because after achieving success in middle age, men tend to think with their lower body.

Combined with the tarot picture book I recently bought, this answer represents a transformation of roles, the rotation of karma and fate.
Using the Sphinx's riddle as an analogy, it's the transformation from the Hermit to the Magician.

When I was in a bad mood before, I would play Guan Yu, the "Homelander" in Honor of Kings, to break up couples. Later, I got tired of Honor of Kings, and after I cracked the ELO mechanism, I would find old friends in four-dimensional space to catch up, or watch some movies and TV shows, and learn new skills.

## Multidimensional Mathematical Explanation of Parallel Universes

    n≠n

## Parallel Universes in Honor of Kings

Parallel universes actually exist. Take Honor of Kings, for example. Tencent has actually developed the ability to abstractly model players. By analyzing user data, they reverse-engineer a "parallel universe" — you think the other nine players are real people, but actually 0~9 of them might not be human.

This creates a kind of temporal-spatial illusion, even making you question your own existence: Am I real?

In my view, **the existence of things cannot be proven**. We need observation to understand things. Without an observer, things do not exist.
"We" are observers ourselves, so we observe "all things in the world."

According to the explanation of "generalized game theory," **a global optimal solution does not exist**. Observation of things cannot cover all dimensions, so cognitive bias is quite normal. A thousand people have a thousand Hamlets.

But if we ourselves are observers, and what we observe is ourselves, then what are "we ourselves"?

## The Parallel Universe of "Self"

In my view, self-awareness is an eternal subject throughout life. "I" can be static or dynamic.

According to a normal person's life journey, there is an identity transformation: infant → student → working professional → parent → retired elder. In my view, this is the parallel universe of "self."

## The Parallel Universe of "I" and "TA"

Although time is the first dimension in my view, different people have different perceptions and understandings of time, which creates differences in worldview and values. How can a cicada understand the ambition of a swan? How can a phoenix understand the meaning of a pheasant?

The parallel universe of "I" and "TA" is that although we appear to be in the same four-dimensional space, we experience different lives.

## Parallel Data Black Holes

In cybersecurity attack and defense exercises, there is also a "parallel universe"-style defense method: returning data that appears correct in format but is actually wrong, achieving a defensive effect. Or simply using a "data black hole" form, making no response at all.

But purely passive data black hole defense is seen as weakness and inaction. In my view, it's a last resort. Small problems will continuously accumulate, snowballing into a big problem.

## What others see is not what I see; what I know is what I know
