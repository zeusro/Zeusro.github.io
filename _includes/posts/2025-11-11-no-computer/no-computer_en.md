Recently, through DNS, I discovered that [this website](https://www.zeusro.com) has more overseas traffic than domestic traffic.
A while ago, when I went back to high school, I found that very few people were studying liberal arts. Most of them were crowding into science, especially computer science.

## Most People Should Not Blindly Study Computer Science

But in my opinion, including myself, most people are actually not very suitable for studying computer science—I just accidentally chose science and was forced to walk the computer science path all the way to the end.

When I first entered the industry, I studied diligently and worked seriously. But in a third-tier city, it actually didn’t mean much; effort always has a ceiling and limit. And the ceiling of a third-tier city is your own parents.

Although to most people, my talent is not ordinary, so countless people envy, resent, and hate me. But in my view, I write very little code, “lacking a big project,” and my ability ceiling is my time, and I have already started to feel the decline of my body.

After 10 years in the industry, I actually spend more time daydreaming than working. And because of the toxic domestic environment, it’s rare to be truly valued. At first, I despised those low-educated colleagues around me who deliberately smoked next to me; but when I came to a big city, I found that I became the one despised.

The domestic environment lacks basic respect for people, always emphasizing various "**control theories**" — as a minor, you are kidnapped through authority relationships (parents and teachers are always right, you must listen to me);
after graduation, you are limited by your job;
when you earn enough money, you can go through the “buy a bigger house, get married, have children” full-package process. Buying one house is not enough; you have to buy one for the eldest son and another for the grandson.

However, material resources are limited, and internet jobs are also limited. Every year, there are millions of college entrance exam graduates; if they all covet the “high salary” of this industry and enter this track, then ineffective internal competition will force this industry to become low-paying.

When going to work becomes a performance, even if there is nothing to do, everyone still has to pretend to work at their desks. I was on the edge of a big company’s OB for a few years and have basically completely demystified them.

## The Paradox of the Internet Industry

Moreover, the first paradox of the internet industry is “Kill Everything” — **the more excellent the practitioners are, the more antisocial they must be**.

The foundation of the internet industry is information technology, and information technology represents a new quality of productivity. Its original setting was to “assist humans,” but gradually it turned into “replacing human jobs,” such as open-source projects devouring closed-source software companies, `Kubernetes` replacing manual operations, and AI destroying grassroots programming jobs (studying computer science at a vocational school is no better than learning car repair).

In China, basically all internet businesses have been fully developed, but there are few internet companies—people generally lack a spirit of interconnection and always think of building “big platforms” behind closed doors to let others join, then collect rent as “landlords.”

But now that AI has emerged, we have a chance to “set things right.” When formulating AI ethics-related laws, I think “**people-oriented, machines as auxiliary**” must be placed first.

Moreover, computer-related textbooks must start to be rewritten.

## The People Who Make Textbooks Do Not Understand Computers at All

In the `Python` language, indentation represents nested levels. If following the existing approach and printing with paper textbooks, indentation becomes blank space, which actually reduces readability.

Not to mention the domestic textbooks are a mess, and the quality is really hard to describe.
Outdated language books are not taken down for a long time, and the authors’ thoughts are backward and inflexible.
The content they write is as hard to understand as a sacred text, only making people want to sleep in class.

The biggest problem with these authors is “laziness.” They think that after muddling through for so many years and finally becoming authorities in education, they can decide the content of textbooks, and their thinking becomes lazy, no longer embracing new changes.

On the other hand, language standards themselves are changing. Although the ancient `C` and `C++` languages are still shining, these obscure and difficult languages are obviously not suitable for most beginners.

`C#` is elegant but lacks an ecosystem; `Java` claims to be cross-platform but is like a clown in the cloud-native field (Java in docker); `Go` claims simplicity but is far from as elegant as `C#`’s `linq` + `lambda` in terms of generics and collection operations compared to 10 years ago.

And computers have been developing for more than 30 years, but our only programming language is an “internal fighting language.”
We only achieve unprecedented unity in internal consumption of this problem.

Those talents who study computer science, after getting a university teaching position, only want to seek stability, relying on flattering leaders and cheating research funds to secure their positions;
and in private enterprises, after 30 years old, they are forced to take the “senior developer” or “management route,” or else they will be accused of “lacking ambition.”

The project management experience and architecture design ideas that private enterprises should really accumulate are completely suffocated by overwork;
and due to the serious disconnection of university computer textbooks, training institutions and paid knowledge learning run rampant.

In summary, computer courses must be fully electronic. For a small number of poor areas, paper printing can be used.

## The Learning Curve Lasts a Lifetime

Those familiar with my coding style know that my code is a kind of “hybrid” art, with prototypes coming from life and solutions coming from reflections on life.

Just like the TSP problem in the P=NP question. I also thought about it for 10 years before concluding that using time to measure the length of N-dimensional line segments can solve the problem.

But at the syntax static analysis level, I still need to learn discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, and linear algebra.

Only after entering this field do you intuitively understand the difference between people, as big as the difference between heaven and earth.

I just waited 5 years until this year’s AI explosion, using N-type AI to complete assisted computing.

In fact, my education is only at the high school level. Occasionally, when bored, I go for interviews and get despised in various ways, with words like “You don’t even have a bachelor’s degree and still want to enter the industry?”

Then I can only show them through actions why in Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, arrogance that disrespects others is the greatest original sin.
